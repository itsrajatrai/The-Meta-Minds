# The Meta Minds
This project aims to investigate the neural correlates of spatial cognition in the Metaverse by simulating the behavior of single cells in the hippocampus using the Integrate-and-Fire (IF) model and the Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) algorithm.

## Background
Spatial cognition is a fundamental cognitive function of the human brain that allows us to move through and understand the spatial organization of an environment. The Metaverse, a virtual reality world where users can interact with digital environments, has sparked interest in comprehending how the brain interprets spatial information in such simulated settings. The goal of this project is to develop a computational framework that can simulate the behavior of individual neurons in the hippocampus and investigate their ability to achieve spatial cognition in the Metaverse.

## Methodology
To accomplish our goal, we use the IF model and STDP algorithm to simulate the behavior of individual neurons in the hippocampus. We also employ a probabilistic generative model (PGM) for navigation in uncertain situations by combining neuroscientific understanding of hippocampus formation (HF) with technical expertise in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). We use the Brain Modelling Toolkit (BMTK) and the Virtual Brain (TVB) to synthesize digital cells from the Allen Brain Atlas dataset and display them in a virtual reality environment.

## Results
Our simulation results reveal that the firing patterns of digital cells in the Metaverse exhibit significant variations depending on the location in the virtual environment, indicating that the cellular activity is influenced by the spatial context. We provide a comparison matrix of the IF and STDP models, as well as a comparison matrix of the firing rates of neurons.

## Limitations
Despite the insights gained from our research, this study has limitations. One of the limitations is the simplification of the digital cells in the simulation, which may not fully represent the complexity of real neurons.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project proposes a novel computational framework for investigating spatial cognition in the Metaverse. Our results suggest that digital cells in the hippocampus exhibit spatial firing patterns that are influenced by the spatial context of the virtual environment. The development of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) that is human-like and highly congruent with the anatomical structure and functions of the hippocampal formation could transform how we interact with virtual environments and develop virtual beings with human-like intelligence.
